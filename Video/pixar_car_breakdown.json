A short, humorous opening scene where a Pixar-style woman's car breaks down dramatically on the side of a road, complete with comical sputtering, a loud backfire, and thick smoke billowing from the hood.  Style:  Modern Pixar-style 3D animation.  Bright, cinematic lighting to contrast with the sudden problem.  Slapstick, physical comedy timing.  Character:  A 3D animated character of a woman in a modern Pixar-style. She has shoulder-length, straight brown hair with a side part. She has large, friendly brown eyes and wears stylish, thin-rimmed glasses. She is wearing a soft sky-blue, short-sleeved knitted T-shirt and has matching soft sky-blue wristbands on her wrists.  Scene & Action Sequence:  Opening Shot (1 sec): A medium shot of the character's turquoise sedan driving smoothly along a pleasant, generic road on a sunny day.  The Breakdown (2 sec): Suddenly, the car begins to shake violently. It makes a series of loud, comical sputtering and coughing sounds. A loud BANG! is heard as a puff of black smoke shoots out of the exhaust pipe.  The Stop (1 sec): The car lurches to a screeching halt at the side of the road.  The Aftermath (1 sec): A moment of silence, then thick, white smoke begins to billow out comically from under the hood. The shot holds on the stranded, smoking car for a moment.  Audio:  Dialogue: None.  Sound Effects: Crucial for the comedy. Exaggerated sounds are key:  Loud, cartoonish engine sputtering and coughing.  A single, loud backfire BANG.  The squeal of tires as the car stops abruptly.  The gentle hissing of the smoke after the engine dies.
